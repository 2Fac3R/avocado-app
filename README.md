# Avocado

This project is an implementation of an avocado-themed e-commerce app. The aim is to learn Next.js + TypeScript by creating components with React and styling them using Semantic UI. It includes features for connecting to an API, in this case, a locally emulated one with corresponding services and types. Additionally, it features a shopping cart system for demonstration purposes.
